          <h3>To Be Or Not To Be</h3>
          <p>currently I am at a great stage of growth. Being mostly self taught in a large array of things, along with teaching others, I have been giving a great deal of effort in personal growth. React is my weapon of choice to learn software engineering. When I am self-teaching I am focusing on just JavaScript a large amount of the time because I believe focusing on one thing then using your experience there will branch out and help you learn faster and better.</p>

          <h3>Technology</h3>
          <p>As a developer I am most acustomed to Web Based technology. Some of these include</p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>React</li>

            <li>C#</li>
            <li>WordPress</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These are listed in order of personal preferance, however I am well versed in all of them. I also know backend and data based technologies in the purpose of building complicated web apps</p>
          <p>My philosophy is use the right technology for the right job, and that will always come first.</p>
